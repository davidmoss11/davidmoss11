# 👋 Hi, I’m David Moss

I’m a Senior Computer Science major building software systems that focus on practical logic, data handling, and real-world use cases. I like working on projects where I start with a problem, design a solution, and build it step by step while learning along the way.

Most of my work is on school projects and personal tools — from rental systems to file integrity checkers, AI-powered tutors, and inventory managers.

## 🛠️ Skills

**Languages:** Java, Python, C++  
**Concepts:** OOP, data structures, algorithms, file I/O, basic security  
**Tools:** Git & GitHub, command line, VS Code, IntelliJ

## 📌 Pinned Projects

Each of these showcases part of what I’ve learned — from backend logic to working with APIs and building usable tools.
